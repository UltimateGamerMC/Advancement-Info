# Advancement Info Continued

This mod is a continuation of the abandoned [Advancement Info](https://modrinth.com/mod/advancementinfo) mod, updated for Minecraft 1.21.9 and 1.21.10+.

## Features

This mod enlarges the advancements UI to use most of your screen instead of just a tiny portion, especially beneficial when your GUI scale is high. This means more information visible at the same time, less scrolling, and a better overview of your progress.

The mod analyzes which advancement requirements you've completed and which remain unfinished, displaying a comprehensive list to the right of the UI. This makes it significantly easier to track what you've accomplished and what still needs to be done.

For example, the "Discover every Biome" advancement doesn't tell you which biomes are still missing—this mod will help you identify that last biome you haven't visited yet.

This works seamlessly with data pack advancements as well. Here's an example from BlazeAndCave:

If the list on the right overflows, you can use your mouse scroll wheel to scroll through it.

Advancements and their objectives have their own internal names, which may or may not correspond to Minecraft items, blocks, or entities. The mod does its best to map those names to Minecraft objects, but in some cases—especially with data packs—that's not possible. The mod will display the internal name in those cases, hoping you can decipher what's needed better than the mod itself.

For example, the objective of "The Parrots and the Bats" is named "bred", which will show as `bred` in the info box.

## How to Use

1. Download the mod from the releases page
2. Place the `.jar` file in your `mods` folder
3. Launch Minecraft with Fabric
4. Open the Advancements screen (default: L key)

7. Scroll in the right panel to see all objectives
